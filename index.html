<h1>COMP 120: Web Engineering</h1>
<h2>Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2017</h2>

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Web applications are complex systems that deliver a plethora of features to a large number of users (including developers), and also exhibit unique behaviors and demands in terms of performance, scalability, usability, and security.  This course will discuss the limits of current web technologies, information and service architectures, caching, session and data management.</p>

<h2>Instructor</h2>

<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jacob Katsiaficas</li>
<li>Justin Sullivan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Class Time</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays, 4:30 - 5:45 PM in Nelson Auditorium</li>
</ul>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>COMP 20: Web Programming or permission by instructor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Semester Project (50%)</li>
<li>Engineering Notebook (30%)</li>
<li>Class participation and subjective factors (20%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Class participation encompasses a variety of activities, all with the same purpose.  To earn high grades for class participation, you must show that you are actively engaged in managing your own learning, developing new skills, and developing new ways of programming and problem-solving. You can be engaged in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking appropriate questions in class</li>
<li>Answering questions when called on in class</li>
<li>Asking appropriate questions on Piazza</li>
<li>Answering questions well on Piazza</li>
<li>Interacting professionally with programming partners and course staff</li>
<li>Working out ideas with teaching assistants</li>
<li>Helping other COMP 120 students (or COMP 20 students for that matter) in Halligan</li>
</ul>

<p>Nobody has to do all of these things; you can earn top grades for class participation by doing just a few things well. In particular, nobody is required to speak in class, but everybody should be prepared to answer questions if called upon.</p>

<p>Professional interactions with other students and with course staff are the same as those which are expected in any workplace. It is also professional for you to recognize that a member of the course staff may be present but not actually available to talk about COMP 120.</p>

<h2 id="notebook">What is the Engineering Notebook and Why For This Class?</h2>
<p>This semester, I am requiring each team to maintain a engineering notebook.  This engineering notebook shall be in electronic format and be made online, one notebook per team.  The notebook can be in form of a blog (e.g., Tumblr, GitHub, WordPress), thus an engineering blog --social media (e.g., via Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat) is not acceptable.  Many professional engineers and engineering teams maintain notebooks for good reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To keep a running record of activities</li>
	<li>To record ideas</li>
	<li>To be used as a legal document for patent activities and even in litigation</li>
	<li>To record what work was done or not done in case a person leaves a project</li>
	<li>To highlight successes</li>
	<li><em>To highlight failures and what should be done the next time</em></li>
	<li>To list upcoming plans and challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of these reasons, I want:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To make the engineering notebooks available to other teams so other teams can learn from your work</li>
	<li>To make you continue to develop your writing skills</li>
</ul>

<p>You may argue that a Git commit history serves the same purpose.  However, Git commit history is largely for the source code.  This course is much more than just writing code.  Example: you will be drawing and communicating visuals.</p>

<p>At least one entry in your engineering notebook is required each week, starting on the week Leg 1 is due.  At the very least, your team will need to highlight the wins and fails of the week, and plans for the upcoming weeks.  The requirement for each entry in engineering notebook: a timestamp of entry.  Back-dating is not acceptable.</p>

<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Because each leg of the semester project is team-based, no extensions will be granted.</li>
	<li>Because this class will have a number of guest speakers and student presentations, laptops or mobile devices are not allowed to be used in class unless specified.  Phones must be silent.  You are allowed to politely step outside of the class to take phone calls (e.g., for emergencies, job offers).</li>
	<li>While you are allowed to use third-party APIs, packages, or libraries for development, I will not help you with any questions or issues that you have with them.</li>
	<li>If you sabotage another team's work or presentation, your team will receive an F in the course.</li>
</ol>
