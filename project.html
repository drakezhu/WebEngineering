<h1>COMP 120: Web Engineering</h1>
<h2>Spring 2017 Semester Project</h2>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p class="stress">Yours truly has become the interim Vice President of Campus Services at a major university.  I am looking for your help to bring Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>

<h3>Responses to Your Questions</h3>
<p>Q: Is there a target audience in mind?</p>
<p>A: Campus Services serve the student, faculty, staff, alumni, guests, and affiliates</p>

<p>Q: What type of solutions: web or mobile?</p>
<p>A: Both. You cannot ignore mobile.  To illustrate the importance of mobile, over 50% of the traffic to our website now come from mobile devices.</p>
 
<p>Q: How many students, faculty, and staff?</p>
<p>A: There is well over 50,000 active student, faculty, and staff in total.  This may / may not include affiliates.</p>
 
<p>Q: Are there services, resources that we can use?</p>
<p>A: We currently have a website which is largely brochureware.</p>
 
<p>Q: What data should be made public? What data should be made private?</p>
<p>A: Data on personnel and anything inventory related (e.g., location and size of water tanks, boilers, devices containing refrigerants) must be made private.  There is also a federal law, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), that protects student data privacy.</p>
 
<p>Q: Is there an Single-Sign On (SSO) system used at the University?</p>
<p>A: Yes, but I do not know much information about it.</p>
 
<p>Q: Do you want a portal for everything or a tool or web apps for specific task?</p>
<p>A: As I mentioned earlier, we currently have a website which is largely brochureware.  Incremental improvements over a massive system make more sense --and less overwhelming for people to deal with.  Lots of people do not need everything.</p>
 
<p>Q: What are the different departments under Campus Services?</p>
<p>A:
<ul>
<li>Building, Energy, and Facilities</li>
<li>Dining</li>
<li>Environmental Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Event Management</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>ID Cards</li>
<li>Mail Services</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>Public Safety</li>
<li>Real Estate</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>Q: Are there are immediate deficiencies you can think of?</p>
<p>A: Process.  We have lots of overhead.  My goal in the next three years is to make Campus Services more efficient and leaner.</p>

<p>Q: Can you give me an idea of the budget?</p>
<p>A: We are looking to hire at least 3 more people to support the mission of bringing Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>
