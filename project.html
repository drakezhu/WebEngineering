<h1>COMP 120: Web Engineering</h1>
<h2>Spring 2017 Semester Project</h2>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p class="stress">Yours truly has become the interim Vice President of Campus Services at a major university.  I am looking for your help to bring Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>

<h3>Responses to Your Questions</h3>
<p>Q: Is there a target audience in mind?</p>
<p>A: Campus Services serve the student, faculty, staff, alumni, guests, and affiliates</p>

<p>Q: What type of solutions: web or mobile?</p>
<p>A: Both. You cannot ignore mobile.  To illustrate the importance of mobile, over 50% of the traffic to our website now come from mobile devices.</p>
 
<p>Q: How many students, faculty, and staff?</p>
<p>A: There is well over 50,000 active student, faculty, and staff in total.  This may / may not include affiliates.</p>
 
<p>Q: Are there services, resources that we can use?</p>
<p>A: We currently have a website which is largely brochureware.</p>
 
<p>Q: What data should be made public? What data should be made private?</p>
<p>A: Data on personnel and anything inventory related (e.g., location and size of water tanks, boilers, devices containing refrigerants) must be made private.  There is also a federal law, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), that protects student data privacy.</p>
 
<p>Q: Is there an Single-Sign On (SSO) system used at the University?</p>
<p>A: Yes, but I do not know much information about it.</p>
 
<p>Q: Do you want a portal for everything or a tool or web apps for specific task?</p>
<p>A: As I mentioned earlier, we currently have a website which is largely brochureware.  Incremental improvements over a massive system make more sense --and less overwhelming for people to deal with.  Lots of people do not need everything.</p>
 
<p>Q: What are the different departments under Campus Services?</p>
<p>A:
<ul>
<li>Building, Energy, and Facilities</li>
<li>Dining</li>
<li>Environmental Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Event Management</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>ID Cards</li>
<li>Mail Services</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>Public Safety</li>
<li>Real Estate</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>Q: Are there are immediate deficiencies you can think of?</p>
<p>A: Process.  We have lots of overhead.  My goal in the next three years is to make Campus Services more efficient and leaner.</p>

<p>Q: Can you give me an idea of the budget?</p>
<p>A: We are looking to hire at least 3 more people to support the mission of bringing Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>

<h2 id="leg1">Leg 1: Your Job Is Not to Write Code</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For the next few weeks, your team will build a minimal viable product of your team's project idea.  A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) "is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort" (<a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html" target="_blank">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html</a>).  Future builds will include user authentication and API design.</p>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraklein/your-job-is-not-to-write-code-d002609b117a#.1v9ki6evg" target="_blank">Your Job Is Not to Write Code</a>.  The point of this reading is to make you think about the value of your work now and in the future.</p>

<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>For Thursday, February 2nd, your team shall prepare and create:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A short description of your team's project idea.</li>
	<li>A data schema for your team's project idea.  While the data schema does not have to be thorough, it should not restrict potential expansion.</li>	
	<li>A wireframe of the most important views of your team's project idea (i.e., the front end).</li>
	<li>An explanation of your team's design rationales.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>The first entry of your <a href="index.html#notebook">engineering notebook</a> shall be about your project.  The entry shall contain pictures of data schema and wireframes.  The entry shall also elaborate on the design rationales.</p>
<p>The notebook can be in form of a blog (e.g., Tumblr, GitHub, WordPress).  An example of a good engineering notebook from the Mobile Development class in fall 2016: <a href="https://lunaandchris.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://lunaandchris.wordpress.com/</a>. Social media (e.g., via Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat) is not acceptable as your engineering notebook.</p>
<p class="note">Email me link to your engineering notebook.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>In class on Thursday, February 2nd, 5 teams, chosen at random at least 24 hours before class, will present their data schema and wireframe to the class.  A selected team will have 5 minutes to explain their design rationale to the class, and 5 minutes for questions and answers from the class.</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>Do not create a slide deck (e.g., a PowerPoint or Google Docs presentation).  It is not a good use of our time.  You also need to develop the skill of giving short verbal pitches (in this case, explaining what your team's project idea is).</p>

<h2 id="leg2">Leg 2: Exploring Your Options</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In previous years, a specific programming language and web framework were chosen for the semester project. (can you guess why?) This year, there will be no technology constraints for the semester project: your team can use any web framework, programming language, or database for the semester project.  While given enormous flexibility this semester, it comes at the expense of understanding risks and limitations.  Your team's goals for this leg are to explore possible options and to weigh the pros and cons of each possible option.  IMPORTANT: your team's job is not to make any decisions until you hear thoughts and comments from other teams in the class.</p>

<p>I've realized that selecting a specific programming language and web framework for the semester project is not necessarily a good thing.  While it forces students to learn perhaps a new programming language or web framework, new programming languages and web frameworks spawn (and change) constantly.  Thus, pigeonholing into specific technologies is a disservice for the long-term.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>As an entry in your team's engineering notebook, select at least two web frameworks, at least two databases, at least two front-end frameworks (if any), and at least two hosting infrastructures that your team may want to use.  For each option, list the pros and cons.  Cons can include cost, lack of knowledge (e.g., members of team have no knowledge of programming language X).  Statements containing little substance such as: "Person A absolutely despises technology Y" are not acceptable.</p>

<h3>Purposes of This Leg</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this leg is to eventually build a good story to tell on <em>why</em> certain technologies are being used.  A good example is Instagram: read <a href="https://engineering.instagram.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad#.slz0w5q5m" target="_blank">https://engineering.instagram.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad#.slz0w5q5m</a>.  The other purpose of this leg is to lead each team build competency in new areas.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>In class on Thursday, February 9th, 5 teams, chosen at random at least 24 hours before class, will present their options to the class.  A selected team will have 5 minutes to explain their options and risk analysis to the class, and 5 minutes for questions and answers from the class.</p>
