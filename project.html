<h1>COMP 120: Web Engineering</h1>
<h2>Spring 2017 Semester Project</h2>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p class="stress">Yours truly has become the interim Vice President of Campus Services at a major university.  I am looking for your help to bring Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>

<h3>Responses to Your Questions</h3>
<p>Q: Is there a target audience in mind?</p>
<p>A: Campus Services serve the student, faculty, staff, alumni, guests, and affiliates</p>

<p>Q: What type of solutions: web or mobile?</p>
<p>A: Both. You cannot ignore mobile.  To illustrate the importance of mobile, over 50% of the traffic to our website now come from mobile devices.</p>
 
<p>Q: How many students, faculty, and staff?</p>
<p>A: There is well over 50,000 active student, faculty, and staff in total.  This may / may not include affiliates.</p>
 
<p>Q: Are there services, resources that we can use?</p>
<p>A: We currently have a website which is largely brochureware.</p>
 
<p>Q: What data should be made public? What data should be made private?</p>
<p>A: Data on personnel and anything inventory related (e.g., location and size of water tanks, boilers, devices containing refrigerants) must be made private.  There is also a federal law, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), that protects student data privacy.</p>
 
<p>Q: Is there an Single-Sign On (SSO) system used at the University?</p>
<p>A: Yes, but I do not know much information about it.</p>
 
<p>Q: Do you want a portal for everything or a tool or web apps for specific task?</p>
<p>A: As I mentioned earlier, we currently have a website which is largely brochureware.  Incremental improvements over a massive system make more sense --and less overwhelming for people to deal with.  Lots of people do not need everything.</p>
 
<p>Q: What are the different departments under Campus Services?</p>
<p>A:
<ul>
<li>Building, Energy, and Facilities</li>
<li>Dining</li>
<li>Environmental Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Event Management</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>ID Cards</li>
<li>Mail Services</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>Public Safety</li>
<li>Real Estate</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>Q: Are there are immediate deficiencies you can think of?</p>
<p>A: Process.  We have lots of overhead.  My goal in the next three years is to make Campus Services more efficient and leaner.</p>

<p>Q: Can you give me an idea of the budget?</p>
<p>A: We are looking to hire at least 3 more people to support the mission of bringing Campus Services at the school to the 21st century with regards to technology.</p>

<h2 id="leg1">Leg 1: Your Job Is Not to Write Code</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For the next few weeks, your team will build a minimal viable product of your team's project idea.  A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) "is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort" (<a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html" target="_blank">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html</a>).  Future builds will include user authentication and API design.</p>

<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraklein/your-job-is-not-to-write-code-d002609b117a#.1v9ki6evg" target="_blank">Your Job Is Not to Write Code</a>.  The point of this reading is to make you think about the value of your work now and in the future.</p>

<h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>For Thursday, February 2nd, your team shall prepare and create:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A short description of your team's project idea.</li>
	<li>A data schema for your team's project idea.  While the data schema does not have to be thorough, it should not restrict potential expansion.</li>	
	<li>A wireframe of the most important views of your team's project idea (i.e., the front end).</li>
	<li>An explanation of your team's design rationales.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>The first entry of your <a href="index.html#notebook">engineering notebook</a> shall be about your project.  The entry shall contain pictures of data schema and wireframes.  The entry shall also elaborate on the design rationales.</p>
<p>The notebook can be in form of a blog (e.g., Tumblr, GitHub, WordPress).  An example of a good engineering notebook from the Mobile Development class in fall 2016: <a href="https://lunaandchris.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://lunaandchris.wordpress.com/</a>. Social media (e.g., via Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat) is not acceptable as your engineering notebook.</p>
<p class="note">Email me link to your engineering notebook.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>In class on Thursday, February 2nd, 5 teams, chosen at random at least 24 hours before class, will present their data schema and wireframe to the class.  A selected team will have 5 minutes to explain their design rationale to the class, and 5 minutes for questions and answers from the class.</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>Do not create a slide deck (e.g., a PowerPoint or Google Docs presentation).  It is not a good use of our time.  You also need to develop the skill of giving short verbal pitches (in this case, explaining what your team's project idea is).</p>
